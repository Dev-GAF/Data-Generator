# Project - Data Generator

This project is a simple application developed in Python to simulate data management. The main idea is to allow the generation of random data, such as name, email, phone number, city, and state, and store them in a text file.

## 📝 Description

The program offers an interactive menu for the user, with the following features:

* View Generated Data: Displays the data previously generated and stored in the text file.
* Generate New Data: Allows the user to generate new random data, which is then saved to the file.
* Clear File: Clears all data stored in the file, leaving it empty.
* Exit Program: Closes the program.

## 👨‍💻 Technologies Used:

Python was used to develop the system's logic, with dictionaries to simulate data storage instead of a real database. The program runs completely in the terminal and uses a simple text file to save the data.
